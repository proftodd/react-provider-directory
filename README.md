A project to learn React.js by creating a searchable and editable provider directory.

I'll be following along with a project I found on the web at http://coenraets.org/blog/2014/12/sample-mobile-application-with-react-and-cordova.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
